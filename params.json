{"name":"Wurk","tagline":"A simple markdown server written in Go","body":"WURK\r\n----\r\n\r\nWurk provides the simplest use case of the Werc framework from cat-v.org. I was\r\nmostly interested in figuring out Go's web tools, but had the side goal of\r\nproducing a very bare bones Markdown engine that could be hacked to my\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nHosting sites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nEach website hosted by Wurk gets its own directory corresponding to its\r\nhostname. For instance, example.com is included, but this could be linked to\r\n127.0.0.1:6969 for testing locally.\r\n\r\nWebsite directories contain a pub directory which is a freeform dump of Markdown\r\nand regular files. All markdown should end in a .md extension. Directories will\r\nnaturally create a site heirarchy. A templates directory contains the look and\r\nfeel of the site in Go's html/template format.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
